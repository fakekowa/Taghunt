## Phase 1 Views Specification & Checklist

### Global Appearance Requirements (All Views)
**Full Screen Utilization:**
- [ ] App must utilize full screen height and width on all devices
- [ ] No black/empty areas at top or bottom of screen
- [ ] Proper handling of device safe areas (notches, status bars)
- [ ] Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Content should fill available screen real estate appropriately

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- [ ] UI elements must render correctly on iOS and Android
- [ ] Consistent layout behavior across different screen densities
- [ ] Proper scaling for tablets and phones
- [ ] Handle landscape and portrait orientations
- [ ] Account for platform-specific UI conventions (iOS safe areas, Android navigation bars)

**MAUI Layout Requirements:**
- [ ] Use proper MAUI layout containers (Grid, StackLayout, etc.)
- [ ] Set appropriate VerticalOptions and HorizontalOptions (Fill, FillAndExpand)
- [ ] Configure proper margins and padding for platform consistency
- [ ] Implement proper view sizing and constraints
- [ ] Handle keyboard appearance/disappearance gracefully

## .NET MAUI Development Guidelines

### Safe Area Handling - CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES

**❌ NEVER DO:**
- Do not use hardcoded margins or padding values like `Value="20,50,20,50"`
- Do not use platform-specific hardcoded values in `<OnPlatform>` tags for safe areas
- Do not guess at device-specific safe area measurements
- Do not use fixed pixel values that don't adapt to different devices

**✅ ALWAYS DO:**
- Use the `SafeAreaBehavior` for dynamic safe area handling
- Implement behaviors that automatically detect device safe areas at runtime
- Use minimum padding fallbacks that work across all devices
- Test on multiple device sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 14 Pro Max, various Android devices)

**Required Implementation Pattern:**
```xml
<!-- Correct safe area implementation -->
<Grid RowDefinitions="Auto,*,Auto"
      VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand"
      HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand">
    <Grid.Behaviors>
        <behaviors:SafeAreaBehavior MinimumPadding="20" />
    </Grid.Behaviors>
    <!-- Content here -->
</Grid>
```

### Layout Container Guidelines

**ContentPage Setup:**
```xml
<ContentPage Shell.NavBarIsVisible="False"
             Shell.TabBarIsVisible="False"
             BackgroundColor="{AppThemeBinding Light={StaticResource White}, Dark={StaticResource Black}}"
             NavigationPage.HasNavigationBar="False">
```

**ScrollView Configuration:**
```xml
<ScrollView VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand"
            HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand">
```

**Grid Layout Best Practices:**
```xml
<Grid RowDefinitions="Auto,*,Auto"
      VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand"
      HorizontalOptions="FillAndExpand">
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Patterns

**Theme-Aware Styling:**
```xml
<!-- Always use theme bindings for colors -->
BackgroundColor="{AppThemeBinding Light={StaticResource White}, Dark={StaticResource Black}}"
TextColor="{AppThemeBinding Light={StaticResource Black}, Dark={StaticResource White}}"
```

**Platform-Specific Adaptations (when needed):**
- Use only for genuine platform differences, not safe areas
- Example: Different animation styles, platform-specific features
- Never for layout measurements or safe area handling

### Dependency Injection Patterns

**Service Registration:**
```csharp
// In MauiProgram.cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAuthService, FirebaseAuthService>();
builder.Services.AddTransient<LoginPage>();
```

**Constructor Injection:**
```csharp
public LoginPage(AuthViewModel viewModel)
{
    InitializeComponent();
    BindingContext = viewModel;
}
```

### Behavior Implementation Guidelines

**Creating Reusable Behaviors:**
- Inherit from `Behavior<T>` where T is the target control type
- Use `BindableProperty` for configurable parameters
- Implement platform-specific logic using conditional compilation (`#if IOS`, `#if ANDROID`)
- Provide sensible fallback values

**Behavior Usage:**
```xml
<Control.Behaviors>
    <behaviors:CustomBehavior Parameter="Value" />
</Control.Behaviors>
```

### File Organization Standards

**Required Folder Structure:**
```
/Behaviors/          - Custom behaviors (SafeAreaBehavior, etc.)
/Converters/         - Value converters
/Models/             - Data models
/Services/           - Business logic services
/Services/Interfaces/- Service contracts
/ViewModels/         - MVVM view models
/Views/              - XAML pages and controls
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Behaviors: `[Purpose]Behavior.cs` (e.g., `SafeAreaBehavior.cs`)
- Services: `[Domain]Service.cs` (e.g., `AuthService.cs`)
- Interfaces: `I[ServiceName].cs` (e.g., `IAuthService.cs`)
- Views: `[Purpose]Page.xaml` (e.g., `LoginPage.xaml`)

### Performance and Resource Management

**Image and Asset Handling:**
- Use vector graphics (SVG) for scalable icons
- Implement proper image caching for user avatars
- Use appropriate image sizes for different screen densities

**Memory Management:**
- Dispose of services and subscriptions properly
- Use weak references for event handlers where appropriate
- Implement proper lifecycle management in view models

### Testing and Device Compatibility

**Required Testing Matrix:**
- iOS: iPhone SE (small screen), iPhone 14 (standard), iPhone 14 Pro Max (large)
- Android: Various screen sizes and densities
- Orientation: Both portrait and landscape
- Theme: Both light and dark modes

**Debug Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] No black areas at screen edges
- [ ] Content properly spaced from device edges
- [ ] UI elements don't overlap with system UI (notches, navigation bars)
- [ ] Consistent appearance across different devices
- [ ] Proper keyboard handling (content doesn't get hidden)

### Error Prevention Rules

1. **Always validate layout on multiple device sizes before considering complete**
2. **Never use magic numbers for spacing - always use behavior-based or system-calculated values**
3. **Test safe area handling on devices with notches/Dynamic Islands**
4. **Verify full-screen utilization requirements are met**
5. **Ensure responsive design works on both phones and tablets**

*These guidelines must be followed for all future development to ensure consistent, professional, and device-compatible user interfaces.*

- **Hunted:** Remaining players who must avoid being caught
- **Role switching:** When caught, hunted players become hunters OR are eliminated (configurable)

#### 3. Game Mechanics
- **Capture System:** Hunter must stay within Y radius of hunted player for X seconds to "tag"
- **Geographic Boundaries:** Players cannot leave predefined game area
- **Time Limit:** Configurable game duration
